# Create Azure Machin Learning Services

## Create Azure Machine Learning Experimentation services accounts
Use the Azure portal to provision your Azure Machine Learning accounts: 
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using the credentials for the Azure subscription you'll use. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) now. 

   ![Azure portal](./media/quickstart-installation/portal-dashboard.png)

1. Select the **Create a resource** button (+) in the upper-left corner of the portal.

   ![Create a resource in Azure portal](./media/quickstart-installation/portal-create-a-resource.png)

1. Enter **Machine Learning** in the search bar. Select the search result named **Machine Learning Experimentation**. 

   ![Azure Machine Learning search](./media/quickstart-installation/portal-more-services.png)

1. In the **Machine Learning Experimentation** pane, scroll to the bottom and select **Create** to begin defining your experimentation account.  

   ![Azure Machine Learning - create experimentation account](./media/quickstart-installation/portal-create-account.png)

1. In the **ML Experimentation** pane, configure your Machine Learning Experimentation account. 

   Setting|Suggested value for tutorial|Description
   ---|---|---
   Experimentation account name | _Unique name_ |Enter a unique name that identifies your account. You can use your own name, or a departmental or project name that best identifies the experiment. The name should be 2 to 32 characters. It should include only alphanumeric characters and the dash (-) character. 
   Subscription | _Your subscription_ |Choose the Azure subscription that you want to use for your experiment. If you have multiple subscriptions, choose the appropriate subscription in which the resource is billed.
   Resource group | _Your resource group_ | Use an existing resource group in your subscription, or enter a name to create a new resource group for this experimentation account. 
   Location | _The region closest to your users_ | Choose the location closest to your users and the data resources.
   Number of seats | 2 | Enter the number of seats. Learn how [seating impacts pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/machine-learning/).<br/><br/>For this Quickstart, you only need two seats. Seats can be added or removed as needed in the Azure portal.
   Storage account | _Unique name_ | Select **Create new** and provide a name to create an [Azure storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=portal). The name should be 3 to 24 characters, and should include only alphanumeric characters. Alternatively, select **Use existing** and select your existing storage account from the drop-down list. The storage account is required and is used to hold project artifacts and run history data. 
   Workspace for Experimentation account | IrisGarden<br/>(name used in tutorials) | Provide a name for a workspace for this account. The name should be 2 to 32 characters. It should include only alphanumeric characters and the dash (-) character. This workspace contains the tools you need to create, manage, and publish experiments.
   Assign owner for the workspace | _Your account_ | Select your own account as the workspace owner.
   Create Model Management account | **check** |Create a Model Management account now so that this resource is available when you want to deploy and manage your models as real-time web services. <br/><br/>While optional, we recommend creating the Model Management account at the same time as the Experimentation account.
   Account name | _Unique name_ | Choose a unique name that identifies your Model Management account. You can use your own name, or a departmental or project name that best identifies the experiment. The name should be 2 to 32 characters. It should include only alphanumeric characters and the dash (-) character. 
   Model Management pricing tier | **DEVTEST** | Select **No pricing tier selected** to specify the pricing tier for your new Model Management account. For cost savings, select the **DEVTEST** pricing tier if it's available on your subscription (limited availability). Otherwise, select the S1 pricing tier. Click **Select** to save the pricing tier selection. 
   Pin to dashboard | _check_ | Select the **Pin to dashboard** option to allow easy tracking of your Machine Learning Experimentation account on the front dashboard page of the Azure portal.

5. Select **Create** to begin the creation process of the Experimentation account along with the Model Management account.

   ![Machine Learning Experimentation account configuration](./media/quickstart-installation/portal-create-experimentation-button.png)

   It can take a few moments to create an account. You can check on the status of the deployment process by clicking the Notifications icon (bell) on the Azure portal toolbar.

## Run a Python script

Now, you can run the **iris_sklearn.py** script on your local computer. This script is included by default with the **Classifying Iris** project template. The script builds a [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) model using the popular Python [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) library.

1. In the command bar at the top of the **Project Dashboard** page, select **local** as the execution target and select **iris_sklearn.py** as the script to run. These values are preselected by default. 

   There are other files included in the sample that you can check out later, but for this quickstart we are only interested in **iris_sklearn.py**. 

   ![Command bar](./media/quickstart-installation/run_control.png)

1. In the **Arguments** text box, enter **0.01**. This number corresponds to the regularization rate, and is used in the script to configure the logistic regression model. 

1. Select **Run** to start the execution of the script on your computer. The **iris_sklearn.py** job immediately appears in the **Jobs** panel on the right so you can monitor the script's execution.

   Congratulations! You've successfully run a Python script in Azure Machine Learning Workbench.

1. Repeat steps 2 - 3 several times using different argument values ranging from **0.001** to **10** (for example, using powers of 10). Each run appears in the **Jobs** pane.

1. Inspect the run history by selecting the **Runs** view and then **iris_sklearn.py** in the Runs list. 

   ![Run history dashboard](./media/quickstart-installation/run_view.png)

   This view shows every run that was executed on **iris_sklearn.py**. The run history dashboard also displays the top metrics, a set of default graphs, and a list of metrics for each run. 

1. You can customize this view by sorting, filtering, and adjusting the configurations using the gear and filter icons.

   ![Metrics and graphs](./media/quickstart-installation/run_dashboard.png)

3. Select a completed run in the Jobs pane to see a detailed view for that specific execution. Details include additional metrics, the files that it produced, and other potentially useful logs.

## Start the CLI

The Azure Machine Learning command-line interface (CLI) is also installed. The CLI interface allows you to access and interact with your Azure Machine Learning services using the `az` commands to perform all tasks required for an end-to-end data science workflow. [Learn more.](../desktop-workbench/tutorial-iris-azure-cli.md)

You can launch the Azure Machine Learning CLI from the Workbench's toolbar using **File â†’ Open Command Prompt**.

You can get help on commands in the Azure Machine Learning CLI using the --help argument.

```az ml --help```
