# Tutorial 1: Classify Iris - Preparing the data (1/3)

Azure Machine Learning service (preview) is an integrated, end-to-end data science and advanced analytics solution for professional data scientists to prepare data, develop experiments, and deploy models at cloud scale.

This tutorial is **part one of a three-part series**. In this part of the tutorial, you use Azure Machine Learning services to:

* Create a project in Azure Machine Learning Workbench

## 1. Configure IDE

In order to work or edit python script, you need an IDE tool. A project on Azure Machine Learning Workbench can be linked to Visual Studio Code easily so you can continue to work on the project.

1. From the Workbench menu, select **File** > **Confugure Project IDE**. 

1. Type **name** as **VS_Code**.

1. Click **Browser** and find Visual Studio Code path.

  - Windows 64-bit - **C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe**

## 2. az Login

In order to run cli for the lab, you need to log in from commnad prompt by following next steps.

1. From the Workbench menu, select **File** > **Open Command Prompt**. 

2. Type **az login**, copy __CODE__ and open a browser, go to <a href="https://aka.ms/devicelogin" about="_blank">device login portal</a> and pate code to textbox.

  > [NOTE] If you are not loged in Azure yet, it may ask you to login azure.

```
az login
```

3. Once authenciateion is done, run following command.

```azcli
az account list --output table
```

And select your subscription for this lab.

```azcli
az account set -s "yoursubscription ID or NANE"
```

4. Confirm your subscriion with following command.

```azcli
az account show
```

## 3. Create a new project in Workbench

1. Launch Workbench by selecting the **Launch Workbench** button on the last screen of the installer. 

1. On the first screen, select **Sign in with Microsoft** to authenticate with the Azure Machine Learning Workbench. Use the same credentials you used in the Azure portal.

Once you are signed in, Workbench uses the first Experimentation account it finds in your Azure subscriptions, and displays all workspaces and projects associated with that account. 

> You can switch to a different Experimentation account using the icon in the lower-left corner of the Workbench application window.


1. Select the plus sign (+) in the **PROJECTS** pane and choose **New Project**.

   Selected workspace | IrisGarden (if it exists) | Choose a workspace that you have created for your Experimentation account in the Azure portal. <br/>If you followed the Quickstart, you should have a workspace by the name IrisGarden. If not, select the one you created when you created your Experimentation account or any other you want to use.
   Project template | Classifying Iris | Templates contain scripts and data you can use to explore the product. This template contains the scripts and data you need for this quickstart and other tutorials in this documentation site.
