# Tutorial 1: Classify Iris - Preparing the data (1/3)

![architecture](./images/arch04.01.png)

Azure Machine Learning service (preview) is an integrated, end-to-end data science and advanced analytics solution for professional data scientists to prepare data, develop experiments, and deploy models at cloud scale.

This tutorial is **part one of a three-part series**. In this part of the tutorial, you use Azure Machine Learning services to:

* Create a project in Azure Machine Learning Workbench

## 1. Create a new project in Workbench

1. Launch Workbench by selecting the **Launch Workbench** button on the last screen of the installer. 

1. On the first screen, select **Sign in with Microsoft** to authenticate with the Azure Machine Learning Workbench. Use the same credentials you used in the Azure portal.

Once you are signed in, Workbench uses the first Experimentation account it finds in your Azure subscriptions, and displays all workspaces and projects associated with that account. 

> You can switch to a different Experimentation account using the icon in the lower-left corner of the Workbench application window.


1. Select the plus sign (+) in the **PROJECTS** pane and choose **New Project**.

Selected workspace | IrisGarden (if it exists) | Choose a workspace that you have created for your Experimentation account in the Azure portal. <br/>If you followed the Quickstart, you should have a workspace by the name IrisGarden. If not, select the one you created when you created your Experimentation account or any other you want to use.
