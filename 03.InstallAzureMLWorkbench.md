## Check hands on lab environment 

To complete this hands on lab, Container Service must be registered. To confirm the Azure resource provider **Microsoft.ContainerRegistry** is registered in your subscription. You must register this resource provider before you can create an environment in step 

1. Open the command-line interface (CLI). (Or continue to work on the commnad prompt from previous setp.) In the Machine Learning Workbench application, on the **File** menu, select **Open Command Prompt**.

2. You can check to see if it's already registered by using the following command:
``` 
az provider list --query "[].{Provider:namespace, Status:registrationState}" --out table 
``` 

You should see output like this:

3. If **Microsoft.ContainerRegistry** or **Microsoft.ContainerService** is NOT registered, you can register it by using the following command:
``` 
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerRegistry 
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService 
```

Registration can take a few minutes. You can check on its status by using the previous **az provider list** command or the following command:
``` 
az provider show -n Microsoft.ContainerRegistry 
az provider show -n Microsoft.ContainerService
``` 

The third line of the output displays **"registrationState": "Registering"**. Wait a few moments and repeat the **show** command until the output displays **"registrationState": "Registered"**.
