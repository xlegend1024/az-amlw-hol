   | |Installation path to Azure Machine Learning Workbench|
   |--------|------------------------------------------------|
   |Windows|C:\Users\\<user\>\AppData\Local\AmlWorkbench|
   |macOS|/Applications/Azure ML Workbench.app|

   The installer will download and set up all the necessary dependencies, such as Python, Miniconda, and other related libraries. This installation also includes the Azure cross-platform command-line tool, or Azure CLI.

1. Launch Workbench by selecting the **Launch Workbench** button on the last screen of the installer. 

   If you closed the installer:
   + On Windows, launch it using the **Machine Learning Workbench** desktop shortcut. 
   + On macOS, select **Azure ML Workbench** in Launchpad.

1. On the first screen, select **Sign in with Microsoft** to authenticate with the Azure Machine Learning Workbench. Use the same credentials you used in the Azure portal to create the Experimentation and Model Management accounts. 

   Once you are signed in, Workbench uses the first Experimentation account it finds in your Azure subscriptions, and displays all workspaces and projects associated with that account. 

   >[!TIP]
   > You can switch to a different Experimentation account using the icon in the lower-left corner of the Workbench application window.
